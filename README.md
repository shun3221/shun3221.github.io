Hi :) My name is Ethan .
I personally build this website or profilo is because i wanted to find a job.
nothing but just this.
From now on, i still don't know how to use gitHub.

I studied Electronics Engineering at the department of electronic and computer enginnering in HKUST(Famously known as stress and tension). prior to my study , i studied Information Technology in Hong Kong Polytechnic Community College.

From now on, i still don't know how to code (xd
I personally like to listening to music, especially tiktok trends and billboard lists on spotify.
i enjoy doing sports and enjoy hanging out with one or 2 friends at school or outside.

I like to talk so people often think that i am an extrovert . Nevertheless, i usually disguise myself as an introvert. But Please do not hesitate to talk to me if you have any ideas that could be helpful to others.:))) i am always a dreamer and a nice guy.

to talk about myself more, i like to listening to music , play music and hopefully to create music :)
